# StringWiggler

A cross-platform simulator of a wiggling string. Move your mouse cursor around the screen and watch a string dangle from it, whipping around as you go. A simple, satisfying, utterly pointless app for when you have nothing better to do.

Built with Vulkan for rendering, supporting Windows, Linux (X11/Wayland), and macOS.
